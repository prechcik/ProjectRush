# ProjectRush

Project Rush was one of my first attempts to create a dedicated server for a mobile game, made in Unity.
The basic idea for Project Rush was to create a social game for people that are bored while commuting on their way to or back from work - player would gain experience and levels based on how much they walk in the game and talk with eachother.
Gaining experience and levels would unlock new outfits for the player using random lootbox idea, and I have planned few more features like additional outfit addons, player effects, instanced areas, day and night cycle etc.
Unfortunately this project died as I had to start full time job and had no time or energy to put into this project just by myself.
